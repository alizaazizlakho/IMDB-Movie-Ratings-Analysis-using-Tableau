# IMDB-Movie-Ratings-Analysis-using-Tableau
This is a visualization of IMDB's dataset that contains all the movie data (ratings, revenue, genre) from the year 2006 to 2016. Through this visualization we can compare the ratings for each movie and the average of movie ratings each year from 2006-2016. We can also see the movie revenue of each year and what movie was the most profitable.

The source of this data was: https://data.world/promptcloud/imdb-data-from-2006-to-2016

This data was visualized by creating seperate sheets and then merging them together in a Dashboard. The final result looked like:
